# Journal Connect

Journal Connect is a platform for users to write their journals and post it online anytime anywhere.
This was my attempt at creating a "social media" like website.

## Sharing

You can let your peers read your journals and share your experiences with others by adding them as friends.

## Fully customizable posts

Upload a photo to make your post look more interesting, you can edit your post whenever you want.

## Project consists of 2 parts

The project is split into client (front end) and server (back end)
